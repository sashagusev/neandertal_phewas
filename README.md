Looking at characteristics of Neandertal SNPs identified by [Simonti et al. 2016 Nature](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6274/737).

* Frequencies and LD-scores are from pre-computed values for HapMap3 SNPs in the [LDSC repository](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc).
* .vals files : MAF/LDSC for ND and HM3 SNPs, as well as ND MAF-matched SNPs.
* dens_plot.R : Generates density plots
* match.sh : Identifies MAF-matched SNPs using phewas.vals (source) and a shuffled hm3.vals (target)
